    "The Schulz, Dayan & Montague 1997 *Science* paper is a seminal finding showing the link between dopamine neurons' firing rate and temporal difference reward prediction error in a Pavlovian conditioning experiment. In this assignment, you will reproduce the model simulations in the paper. You should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- carefully read the paper (you can find it in the EC6 folder in bcourses).\n",
    "- code the model as explained in the paper.\n",
    "- reproduce figure 3 of the paper. You don't have to reproduce it *exactly* visually, but do your best to make your plots show the same qualitative results as in the figure.\n",
    "- change some parameters of the model, visualize the corresponding changes, and explain in one paragraph what differences you observe and why you think they happened.\n",
